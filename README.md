## Introduction
This repository contains code and analysis for a project focused on understanding customer churn in the telecom industry. By exploring various aspects of customer behavior and communication services, we aim to provide insights that can help businesses reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We've conducted a thorough EDA to understand various factors affecting customer churn, such as service plans, call statistics, and more.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we've created informative visualizations to make complex data more accessible.
- **Statistical Analysis:** We've examined correlations between variables and uncovered patterns that offer valuable insights.
- **Recommendations:** Based on our findings, we've suggested strategies and actions for businesses to mitigate churn and enhance their services.
